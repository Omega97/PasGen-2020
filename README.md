# PasGen-2020
Super secure password generator

1) Write your username (text is hidden for safety reasons); a hash will appear, same username = same hash

Unique passwords will be generated using your username.
You can use almost all the buttons of the keyboard (including all characters, all Fn buttons, PagUp, PadDown, End, arrows, Esc, Tab)

Example: "Master" + F1 + PagUp + 97

2) Write a keyword to generate a password

To change length, add a space + a number at the end of the string.
You can keep writng kewords like that indefinitely.

Examples: "Amazon", "Amazon 20", "Amazon 30"


Note: Ctrl isn't a char on it's own, but it can be used in combination with almost any other character 
(like Ctrl + A, Ctrl + Tab, Ctrl + Arrow, Ctrl + F5, Ctrl + Shift + 5, ...)

Note: likewise, Shift isn't a char on it's own, bat it modifies most of the other characters
(like Shift + 5, Shift + F7)
